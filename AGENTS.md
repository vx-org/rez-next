## Project Overview

rez-next is a **high-performance Rust rewrite** of the [Rez](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/rez) package manager with Python bindings. It supports common Rez workflows without mirroring Rez's internal implementation modules.

**Key facts for agents:**
- Language: Rust 2024 edition (MSRV 1.95) + Python 3.9+ bindings (PyO3 abi3)
- Build system: Cargo workspace (21 crates) + Maturin for Python
- Current version: 0.4.0 (see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)) <!-- x-release-please-version -->
- License: Apache 2.0
- Python API: curated top-level interfaces backed by native PyO3 modules
- CLI: **28 subcommands** (config, context, view, env, release, test, build, search, bind, depends, solve, cp, mv, rm, status, diff, pkg-help, plugins, pkg-cache, suites, bundle, pip, complete, forward, gui, parse-version, self-test, self-update)
- Status: Common workflows work with `import rez_next as rez`; internal namespaces such as `rez.utils` are intentionally not mirrored.

## Quick Start

```python
# Drop-in replacement for most use cases
import rez_next as rez
from rez_next.packages_ import iter_packages, get_latest_package
from rez_next.resolved_context import ResolvedContext

# Supported top-level API
ctx = rez.resolve_packages(["python-3.9", "maya-2024"])
pkg = rez.get_latest_package("python")
```

## Key Concepts for Agents

### 1. Curated Compatibility Strategy
- Users can `import rez_next as rez` for supported workflows
- Familiar top-level names are retained where they serve those workflows
- Rez internal implementation modules are not mirrored

### 2. Development Workflow
```bash
# Build
vx just build

# Test
vx just test

# Lint
vx just lint

# Full CI check
vx just ci

# Benchmarks
vx just bench
```

### 3. Python Integration Testing
```bash
# Build wheel + run tests (recommended)
vx just py-build
vx just py-test

# Full Python CI
vx just py-ci
```

### 4. Release Process
- Automated via [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
- Multi-platform builds (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Publishes to crates.io and PyPI

## Common Agent Tasks

### Task 1: Understanding Module Coverage
→ Read `docs/python-integration.md` for implemented Python submodules

### Task 2: Adding a New Feature
1. Implement in appropriate `crates/` module
2. Expose via `rez-next-python` if needed
3. Add tests (Rust: `#[test]`, Python: `pytest`)
4. Update documentation
5. Run `vx just ci` before submitting PR

### Task 3: Debugging Solver Issues
→ Check `crates/rez-next-solver/` (A* algorithm implementation)
→ Enable debug logging: `RUST_LOG=debug`

### Task 4: Performance Optimization
→ Run benchmarks: `vx just bench`
→ Profile with `docs/performance.md` guide
→ Check `crates/rez-next-cache/` for caching opportunities

## API Quick Reference

### Version Operations
```python
import rez_next as rez
v1 = rez.Version("1.2.3")
v2 = rez.Version("2.0.0")
print(v1 < v2)  # True

# Version ranges
r = rez.VersionRange(">=3.9,<4.0")
print(r.contains(v1))  # False
```

### Package Queries
```python
from rez_next.packages_ import get_latest_package, iter_packages
pkg = get_latest_package("python")
for p in iter_packages("maya"):
    print(p.version)
```

### Dependency Resolution
```python
from rez_next.resolved_context import ResolvedContext
ctx = ResolvedContext.resolve_packages(["python-3.9", "maya-2024"])
```

### Context Diff (rez.diff)
```python
from rez_next.diff import diff_contexts
result = diff_contexts(["python-3.9"], ["python-3.11", "maya-2024"])
```

## Configuration Files for Agents

- `vx.toml` → Tool version management (use `vx` command)
- `justfile` → Common development tasks
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` → CI pipeline definition
- `release-please-config.json` → Release automation
- `renovate.json` → Dependency updates
- `deny.toml` → Supply chain security (cargo-deny)

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Not all Rez features are implemented** — check coverage before suggesting code changes

⚠️ **Python bindings are partial** — `rez_next` has 40 Python modules + 35 native submodules, covering most Rez APIs but not every edge case

⚠️ **Breaking changes possible** — pre-1.0 project, API may change
